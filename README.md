# Z-tech - Challenge

## Overview

The goal here is to find out the coordinates of an address entered by the user and find the nearest saller using zé delivery's public api. And then show all the products that the seller has to offer.

## Running the app

To do so, install all the dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Then start the project by running:
```
npm start
```

The server will start and should open your default browser automatically. If not, you can access the link:
- [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

Now just type the address "Rua Américo Brasiliense, São Paulo" as an example. Hit "Enter" with all your might and watch react and redux do the job.

## Testing

I wrote some tests to ensure that our reducers and actions works correctly. And also to ensure that our App starts without "crashing" anything. To test, run:
```
npm test
```

## Additional Thoughts

* I tried to be very objective in fulfilling the test proposal. So, it is possible that you will find some case of error not covered. I also focused on solving only what is necessary for the main functioning of the App. So don't be mad at me. And remember, if you're good at something, don't do it for free. xD
* I ended up trying some things that I hadn't used before. So if you see something like "styled components" or anything like that, it's just me taking the time to practice. Thank you!
